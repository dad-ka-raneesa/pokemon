          <p>Golbat bites down on prey with its four fangs and drinks the victim's blood. It becomes active on inky dark
            moonless nights, flying around to attack people and Pokémon. Golbat loves to drink the blood of living
            things.
            It is particularly active in the pitch black of night. This Pokémon flits around in the night skies, seeking

          <p>From its mouth Gloom drips honey that smells absolutely horrible. Apparently, it loves the horrid stench.
            It
            sniffs the noxious fumes and then drools even more of its honey. Gloom releases a foul fragrance from the

            Once the prey are immobilized, this Pokémon catches and devours them. Vileplume's toxic pollen triggers
            atrocious allergy attacks. That's why it is advisable never to approach any attractive flowers in a jungle,

          <p>Golduck is the fastest swimmer among all Pokémon. It swims effortlessly, even in a rough, stormy sea. It
            sometimes rescues people from wrecked ships floundering in high seas. The webbed flippers on its forelegs
            and
            hind legs and the streamlined body of Golduck give it frightening speed. This Pokémon is definitely much
            faster
            than even the most athletic swimmer.</p>

          <p>Tentacruel has tentacles that can be freely elongated and shortened at will. It ensnares prey with its
            tentacles and weakens the prey by dosing it with a harsh toxin. It can catch up to 80 prey at the same time.
            Tentacruel has large red orbs on its head. The orbs glow before lashing the vicinity with a harsh ultrasonic
            blast. This Pokémon's outburst creates rough waves around it.</p>

          <p>Doduo's two heads contain completely identical brains. A scientific study reported that on rare occasions,

            hearts
            and lungs as well, so it is capable of running long distances without rest. Watch out if Dodrio's three
            heads
            are looking in three separate directions. It's a sure sign that it is on its guard. Don't go near this

          <p>Voltorb is extremely sensitive—it explodes at the slightest of shocks. It is rumored that it was first

            when a Poké Ball was exposed to a powerful pulse of energy. Voltorb was first sighted at a company that
            manufactures Poké Balls. The link between that sighting and the fact that this Pokémon looks very similar to
            a
            Poké Ball remains a mystery.</p>

          <p>Magikarp is virtually useless in battle as it can only splash around. As a result, it is considered to be
            weak.
            However, it is actually a very hardy Pokémon that can survive in any body of water no matter how polluted it
            is.
            Magikarp is a pathetic excuse for a Pokémon that is only capable of flopping and splashing. This behavior
            prompted scientists to undertake research into it.</p>
